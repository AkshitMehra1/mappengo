## Inspiration

**[MappenGo](https://github.com/shardic1/mappengo)** was built with two things in mind, community growth and sustainable travel. It is one of it's kind, all in one travel scheduling and vacation spot management application that empowers the user with real-time crowd data at a particular destination, so that they can choose with their own convenience thier next travel.

## What it does

MappenGo, being community driven, while serving as an all-in-one travel app, empowers the users with real-time statistics of the amount of crowd that is visiting a particular place, journey planning, checklists, city facts, and much more. It was designed with robustness in mind and will continue to be a community driven application.

## How we built it

The application is itself derived from an open-source project, provided under an ```MIT License``` (free to use 'as-is'). We scraped some of the features that we thought were more or less commercially driven, and gave the application a robust feel. The forked source code is altered to provide room for more features and in future, implement our much anticipated and thought-of "Heat Maps".

## Challenges we ran into

While forking the original open source code, we had mammoth issues with understanding the core structure of the original, commercially-centred application. We had to improve upon the underlying structure of the package file, in essence, ```cleaning the code```, while at the same time, improving underlying features to give way to future additions.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were happy to realise that we were supporting the community, with future commercial outlooks in mind, although presently community driven. We are also proud of open-sourcing our application, which in turn paves way for the original open-sourcing goal.

## What we learned

We learnt that forking an open-source is much, much harder than it looks. It almost took us nearly half the time we had on our hands to understand the underlying structure, which taught us that maintenance is important than unnecessary creation.

## What's next for MappenGo

MappenGo will continue to be a community driven appliction for professional travellers, travel enthusiasts, and the common folk in general, at least for a long time. Our main goal was, is, and will be to cater to the needs of the community to build a strong user base, which will in turn foster a rapid growth by word of mouth.

## Why did we wanted to create it

We wanted to support Sustainable tourism so the people dont have to go to the messy crowded places but instead they can find something which is very less crowded and has the same feeling to travel. We focused the app on every type of people that would travel in any sort of manner.
