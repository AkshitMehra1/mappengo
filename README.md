A must-have app for those interested in travel. The app provides users with various features including **choosing the correct destination** , **making all the bookings** , and **easily organizing the trip**. The platform basically uses a [mash-up technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(web_application_hybrid)). The app provides solutions for common problems a traveller might face during the course of their journey.

## How Travel Mate Works

Travel Mate was designed as a complete platform for travel. The app provides everything needed to assist users with their travel plans, including choosing transportation, discovering local venues, and managing expenses. 

## Select Destination
A comprehensive list of all the information about a destination: current weather, the best place to hangout, or most popular restaurants. Along with the information, the current trend of the city on twitter can also be seen. (It is extracted from Twitter using Twitter and Yahoo! APIs).
Based on this information and the recommendation from the app, user can opt for the preferred destination location.

## Travel

### Real Time Locator
For users travelling in unfamiliar cities, the app also provides real-time information about places around them as they travel through the city, including monuments, restaurants, hotels, medical centres, etc.
